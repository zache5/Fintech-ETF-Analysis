# Fintech-ETF-Analysis
With this code, I am creating different plots to demonstrate the returns that an individual would get if they were to be trading this specific ETF over the past couple years. I will also be analyzing PYPL, which is a single stock in the ETF, by creating and calling different SQL queries.

## Technologies
In this code, I used Pandas, Numpy, Hvplot, and sqlalchemy.

## Installation Guide
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
import sqlalchemy

## Usage
As a result of creating the multiple SQL tables and storing all of the assets values in a dataframe, I was able to create charts that demonstrate the cumulative returns for the ETF and PYPL's performance. With a quick switch in the code, we can review the returns for many assets!
